# Qtrip_Dynamic
QTrip is a dynamic travel website aimed at travellers looking for a multitude of adventures in different cities.
During the course of this micro-experience, I have created:

Created web pages using HTML 5 and CSS and made them dynamic using JavaScript
Improved UX with multi-select filters, image carousels
Implemented conditional rendering of page elements. Fetch data using REST APIs and dynamically render landing page
Utilized localStorage to persist user preferences at client-side
Used JQuery to facilitate the reservation form submission
